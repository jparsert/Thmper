# Thmper
An "interactive" Theorem Prover for First-order Logic

This is my attempt at building a small LCF-style theorem prover that is incomplete and most likely unsound.        
The core syntax and semantics can be found in `core.ml`.    
A string version (string variable/atom identifiers) can be found in `string_prover.ml`. There one can also find some     
theorems and even a double negation elimination tactic.
